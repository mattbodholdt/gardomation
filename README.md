# meross automation

Python scripts using the meross_iot SDK to control Meross devices.

Use case is I have an outlet that needs to control in seconds as the unit, not minutes, so the timers in the app are insufficient.  (See powerControl/loopedOutletController.py)

The environment sensor one is useful too, but only to a point really.
